<h1> Stage 0: Project </h1>

    <p> In <em> today's </em> 
    <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673"> 
    session </a> 
    I gained first insights into the world of programming. 
    In the following paragraphs the main points of the lecture are briefly summarized.</p>
    
    <p> <b> The Web </b> <br>
    The Web is a collection of HTML <em>(HyperText Markup Language)</em> documents. It was developed
    in the 1990s and currently comprises about 30bn pages. 
    <br>
    Through <em>web  browsers </em> like (Firefox or Chrome) <em>personal computers</em> operated by end users can 
    send specific requests to <em>servers</em> which then return HTML documents. 
    The global network consisting of (among others) computers and servers is called the Internet. 
    </p>
    
    <p> <b> Features of HTML </b> <br>
    The syntax of HTML comprises three key components. 
    <br>
    <br>
    1. <em>Tags</em> specify the content.<br>
    2. <em> Elements </em> mostly consist of an opening and closing tag (exception: "Void tags") and content 
    inbetween.<br>
    3. <em> Attributes </em> may prompt additional operations.</p>
    
    <p> <b> Additional information </b> <br>
    Computers incapacity to cope with even the slightes deviations from formal code requires programmers 
    to be highly accurate in their commands. In doing so they can however rely on a vast amount of 
    online sources. </p>
